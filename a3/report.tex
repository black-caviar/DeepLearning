\section{Introduction}
This assignment was completed with TensorFlow using a two layer perceptron. The completed model achieves a 95.99\% accuracy on the provided test dataset and a 95.63\% accuracy on the validation subset. It uses a total of 14,320 trainable parameters. As part of the assignment, a custom data loader titled ``MNISTload.py'' was developed and is provided below.

\noindent
From the loss plot one can see that the validation loss begins to exceed the training loss within the first 10 epochs. This suggests a degree of overfitting and increased regularization would be required to fix this. This was not done as the desired accuracy had been achieved.
